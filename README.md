In my exploratory data analysis (EDA) in R, I investigate various aspects of Bitcoin (BTC) market behavior, focusing on its cyclicality and investment potential. Key questions addressed include:

I) Cyclicality Related to Halvings: Analyzing BTC price charts with marked halving events, ATH (all-time highs), and ATL (all-time lows) to visualize their impact on market cycles.

II) Interest in BTC During Market Cycles: Utilizing Google Trends data to identify phases of heightened interest in BTC.

III) Investment at Peak Interest: Simulating returns on investments made during ATH, accounting for subsequent declines and recovery periods.

IV) Optimal Entry Points: Evaluating investment strategies using moving averages to avoid buying at ATH.

V) Seasonality in Monthly Returns: Identifying patterns in BTC's monthly returns to detect potential seasonality.

VI) Volatility Over Time: Assessing whether BTC's volatility has decreased over the years.

VII) BTC vs. Nasdaq100 Volatility: Comparing BTC's standard deviation with Nasdaq100 over the same time frame.


This EDA aims to uncover actionable insights and inform better investment decisions.
